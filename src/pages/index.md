# The Creative Cloud Developer Community

Multiple focuses. Many identities. A singular mission to empower creativity.

<TextBlock slots="image, heading, text" width="33%" theme="dark" isCentered />

![](images/dev-days.jpg)

### Multiple focuses

Creative Cloud developers can build plugins and scripts for a single Creative Cloud app, or multiple apps at once. Or they can integrate services from Adobe into their own products. Some developers do all of these things!

<TextBlock slots="image, heading, text" width="33%" theme="dark" isCentered />

![](images/workshop.jpg)

### Many identities

Creative Cloud developers may identify as _developer_, _scripter_, _entrepreneur_, _business owner_, and yes: _creative_ or _artist_. Some have worked with Adobe APIs for many years; others are learning their first JavaScript today.

<TextBlock slots="image, heading, text" width="33%" theme="dark" isCentered />

### A singular mission

No matter why or how they got here, Creative Cloud developers are on a mission to inspire and empower creatives to get more done in less time, collaborate in new ways, and push the boundaries of creativity.
