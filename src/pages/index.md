## Integrate Creative Cloud Libraries

Creative Cloud Libraries are the foundation of creative systems, powering asset re-use across teams and documents. With the Libraries API, you can seamlessly connect your application with Creative Cloud by giving your users and their teams direct access to all their creative elements stored in Libraries.

# The Creative Cloud Developer Community

Multiple focuses. Many identities. A singular mission to empower creativity.

<TextBlock slots="image, heading, text" width="33%" theme="dark" isCentered />

![](images/dev-days.jpg)

### Multiple focuses

Creative Cloud developers can build plugins and scripts for a single Creative Cloud app, or multiple apps at once. Or they can integrate services from Adobe into their own products. Some developers do all of these things!

<TextBlock slots="image, heading, text" width="33%" theme="dark" isCentered />

![](images/workshop.jpg)

### Many identities

Creative Cloud developers may identify as _developer_, _scripter_, _entrepreneur_, _business owner_, and yes: _creative_ or _artist_. Some have worked with Adobe APIs for many years; others are learning their first JavaScript today.

<TextBlock slots="image, heading, text" width="33%" theme="dark" isCentered />

### A singular mission

No matter why or how they got here, Creative Cloud developers are on a mission to inspire and empower creatives to get more done in less time, collaborate in new ways, and push the boundaries of creativity.
